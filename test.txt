Who can remember what change is like? The biggest changes are the ones  that we just can't feel. They just take too long. We can remember remember what things were like before they happen... We can feel those things. I remember tumbling backwards, one sunny summer afternoon when I was five years old, and cutting my head on a picnic table. That memory is vivid. I remember the day; I had spent it outside with my family, eating watermelon and shooting water guns. Then, in a moment of excitement - and was it fear? - I took a quick step backwards and didn't get hit by the water.

I remember *that*... I remember **those** things... What I just can't remember is how I changed from that boy, the one that couldn't believe the doctor in the emergency room when he was told what stitches are, to the person that I am now, the one that is sitting here at this desk desperately trying to think of words that can go together. But that's a big change. Really, it's an unimportant one. So long, so gradual, so boring. It's put me to sleep several thousand times. It's just so utterly boring. I could dissect and relive and attempt to understand that whole period in its entirety... But I don't care to; I won't write about anything so boring, nor will I make anybody read about anything like that.  

The biggest change in my life to this point, that I can recall vividly that is, has been beginning university. I was only fourteen then. For me, that was jarring thing. The abrupt transition, from being an eclectic homeschooler to being a student at a large rigid university, was jarring and had a huge impact on me, as a person and student, and on my plans and aspirations.

Sudden, jarring changes always impact us. They are like being woken from a long sleep by the pouring of cold water over your face. They are like being yanked from the sensation of a good meal when you bite down on your fork. Of course *those* things don't always leave a mark on us. Usually we escape with nothing but a memory of a painful, intense, even frightening experience. Usually we don't bite down too hard. Actually, we don't bite down hard enough. If there is enough water, it will fill our lungs and damage them. If we hit the fork with enough passion and force, it will take some of our teeth.
